ADKG implementation for the Kyber library as part of the 2025 spring semester student project under the superivison of Prof. P.Borso.


### Import the library

The latest version on master is needed thus we can't simply import kyber as is.
Run this:

`go get -u go.dedis.ch/kyber/v4@master`

After that you might be prompted (typically on goland this is the case) to run this:

`go get -t student_25_adkg`
